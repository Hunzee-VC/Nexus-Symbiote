# Architecture and trust boundaries

This page shows how Nexus SymBiote is put together, where untrusted data enters,
and which module is responsible for each control. Read it before you change a
collector, a gate or an export. The [security model](security-model.md) states the
design principles and what results establish; the [threat model](threat-model.md)
lists the attacks each boundary is meant to stop; the
[known limitations](known-limitations.md), summarized in the
[security policy](../SECURITY.md#known-limitations), list what the controls do not
cover.

## Data flow

```text
            operator inputs (trusted): command-line options and environment,
        collection limits, signer policy, launch policy, binding key, live mode,
                           trusted attestation keys

Every command runs offline unless the operator selects live mode, which only three
commands use:

| Command | Reaches | Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `discover-mcp` | A remote MCP server over HTTPS, at an origin the operator approves | `scanners/live_mcp.py`, `live/inventory.py` |
| `verify-live` | MCP servers started from operator-pinned stdio launchers | `live/stdio.py`, `live/verify.py` |
| `advisories` | The OSV API, with exact package names and versions | `advisories.py` |

The runtime layer is separate: a Python library (`runtime.py`, `live/session.py`)
and the `runtime` commands, which sign and verify contracts and mediate tool calls
through `ReferenceGateway`. It reads no checkout; see
[runtime assurance](runtime-assurance.md).

## What a scan does

`scan` runs the whole pipeline in one command (`cli.py`):

1. **Policy.** It loads `.nexus-symbiote.yaml` from the scan root, unless
   `--no-project-policy` is given, and any operator signer policy. Every
   relaxation of the built-in gates is recorded in `policy_weakened`.
2. **Collection.** Each selected collector reads the checkout through the confined
   reader and returns components, relationships, findings, scanned surfaces, gaps
   and failures. Recorded paths are made relative to the scan root.
3. **Assembly.** Results merge into one AgentBOM. The repository agent is added,
   from `agent.yaml` when it exists ([agent manifest](agent-manifest.md)), and the
   relationship graph is checked.
4. **Coverage.** The inventory records a completeness claim: which collectors were
   requested and completed, each collector's status (`complete`, `partial`,
   `failed`, or `unknown` when it did not run), what was excluded and what failed.
5. **Gate.** The risk policy scores the findings. The scan gate fails on any
   collection failure and on every reason the risk gate reports, such as
   incomplete coverage, a finding at or above `fail_on_severity` or a score at or
   above `fail_threshold`; the [finding catalog](finding-catalog.md#how-findings-affect-the-gates)
   lists them all.
6. **Output.** The inventory is written as native JSON or exported once to
   CycloneDX, SPDX or SARIF.

`validate --project` and `risk --project` repeat steps 1 to 4 on the checkout and
compare the result with the inventory they were given. `baseline` runs `scan` and
writes the inventory only when the scan gate passes, and passes again under the
built-in policy.

## Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `cli.py`, `supply_chain_cli.py`, `live_cli.py`, `runtime_cli.py`, `reporting.py` | Parse operator input, select the policy, run one command, print every untrusted string inert, and turn gate results into exit codes |
| `modes.py` | Keep every command offline unless the operator selects live mode for a live command; enforce it with patched entry points and a CPython audit hook |
| `limits.py` | The operator's [collection limits](collection-limits.md), from `--limit` and `NEXUS_SYMBIOTE_LIMITS` only |
| `utils/confined.py` | The only way collectors read the checkout: descriptor-relative and bounded, regular files only, with identity checked again after each read |
| `scanners/` | One collector per surface: `mcp`, `model`, `prompt`, `rag`, `registry`, `a2a`, `ide_agents` and `shadowscan`. They parse statically and never execute, import or load what they read |
| `core/` | Pydantic models of the native format (`models.py`, `aibom.py`), RFC 8785 hashing of tool definitions and SHA-256 of files (`hashing.py`), and the coverage assessment that `validate` and `risk` share (`coverage.py`) |
| `validators/` | Completeness and reconciliation with a fresh collection (`completeness.py`), digests and operator signatures (`integrity.py`), and risk scoring (`risk.py`) |
| `policy.py`, `signature_policy.py` | The project policy a trusted checkout may supply, and the operator's signer policy, which is refused inside the scanned project |
| `diff/differ.py` | Compare two inventories field by field and rate each change |
| `graph.py`, `lineage.py` | Assemble the repository agent and answer `blast-radius`; `lineage.py` is a library helper that no command uses |
| `risk_classes.py`, `graph_view.py`, `graph_cli.py` | Derive risk classes and exposure paths for display, never writing them to the inventory, and render the self-contained `graph` view ([graph view](graph-view.md)) |
| `core/content_digest.py`, `digest_cli.py` | The inventory content digest and the `digest` command ([reproducible inventories](reproducible-inventories.md)) |
| `attestation.py`, `attestation_cli.py` | Sign and verify inventory attestations, DSSE envelopes over in-toto statements with operator-held Ed25519 keys ([inventory attestation](inventory-attestation.md)) |
| `otlp.py`, `trace_evidence.py`, `trace_cli.py` | Read OTLP/JSON traces within fixed bounds and an attribute allowlist, and reconcile what they report with an inventory as `reported` evidence ([trace evidence](trace-evidence.md)) |
| `crosswalk.py`, `crosswalk_cli.py` | The framework crosswalk catalog that SARIF rule tags come from, and the `crosswalk` report ([framework crosswalk](framework-crosswalk.md)) |
| `minimum_elements.py`, `minimum_elements_cli.py` | G7 AI SBOM minimum-element coverage of an inventory's CycloneDX export ([G7 minimum elements](minimum-elements.md)) |
| `inventory_export.py`, `inventory_export_cli.py` | Export the reviewed repository agent as a ShadowScan simple-list inventory ([ShadowScan approval](shadowscan-inventory-export.md)) |
| `generators/` | Project the native inventory to CycloneDX 1.7, SPDX 3.0.1, SARIF 2.1.0 and CycloneDX VEX, and recover a native inventory from a CycloneDX or SPDX export |
| `scanners/live_mcp.py`, `live/`, `advisories.py` | Live observation and OSV queries; see [offline and live modes](offline-and-live-modes.md) |
| `runtime.py`, `runtime_validation.py`, `live/session.py` | Signed runtime contracts, the reference gateway, schema validation in a separate worker process, and the pinned stdio session |
| `utils/terminal.py`, `utils/files.py`, `utils/secrets.py` | Inert terminal and CI output, atomic output files, and redaction |
| `utils/markdown.py` | The text of a Markdown file outside its code, as CommonMark reads it, from which the `prompt` collector takes `@path` imports |

## Trust boundaries

| Boundary | What crosses it | Trust | Controls |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Checkout | Every file under the scan root, with its name, size and links | Hostile | Descriptor-relative reads with `O_NOFOLLOW` on every path component; only a relative symlink to a regular file or directory inside the root is read through its target; [collection limits](collection-limits.md) that fail closed and name the limit; strict JSON (duplicate keys and non-finite numbers refused) and YAML (anchors, aliases and tags refused, except in Compose files, whose aliases and merge keys are followed within fixed bounds); static parsing only; the offline guard; problems recorded as gaps or failures |
| Project policy | `.nexus-symbiote.yaml` at the scan root, or at the `--project` root | Trusted only for your own checkout | Read from that root only, strict schema, every relaxation listed in `policy_weakened`; `--no-project-policy` ignores it; it cannot select live mode or change a collection limit ([policy reference](policy-reference.md)) |
| Operator inputs | Options, environment variables, the Action's inputs, signer and launch policies, the binding key, trusted attestation keys | Trusted | Signer and launch policies are refused inside the scanned project; the binding key never enters the inventory; a trusted attestation key inside a git working tree that holds the subject, the envelope or the current directory is refused ([trusted keys](inventory-attestation.md#trusted-keys)) |
| Supplied inventories and reports | Native AgentBOMs, ShadowScan reports, exports passed to recovery, attestation envelopes, OpenTelemetry trace files | Hostile | Bounded strict loading of regular files without symbolic links (16 MiB for an inventory or a ShadowScan report, 64 MiB for an export passed to recovery or a trace file, 2 MiB for an attestation envelope); format-version check; reconciliation with a fresh collection under `--project`; digest checks on embedded native documents; imported claims kept apart from local evidence; attestation signatures checked before the payload is parsed; trace files read within fixed bounds, with content attributes never read and telemetry kept `reported` |
| Network peers | Remote MCP servers and OSV, in live mode | Hostile | HTTPS only, to the origins the operator approves with `--allowed-origin` or to the OSV API; resolution pinned to public addresses, no redirects or proxies, bounded responses; tools are never called |
| Pinned launchers | Executables a `verify-live` launch policy names | Trusted bytes, untrusted behavior | SHA-256 pin checked on a private copy, no inherited environment (only a default `PATH`), private working directory, process-group termination; run them in an external sandbox ([launch policy](cli-reference.md#launch-policy)) |
| Runtime callers | Tool calls, contracts and evidence given to the gateway | Hostile | Ed25519 DSSE envelopes, one key ring per purpose, signer quorums, revocation in signed trust statuses, supersession, rollback protection and one-use approvals in the state store, schema validation in a bounded worker ([runtime contract reference](runtime-contract-reference.md)) |
| Output | Terminal, CI log, files, the `graph` HTML page and Markdown reports | Not applicable | Untrusted text made inert and never at the start of a line; the Action relays child output inside a `stop-commands` block and writes its outputs before collection starts; files written atomically and never through a symbolic link ([output and CI logs](cli-reference.md#output-and-ci-logs)); the `graph` page HTML-escapes every inventory string and runs only its own style block and script, pinned by Content-Security-Policy hashes ([graph view](graph-view.md#how-the-page-is-made-safe-to-open)); `crosswalk` Markdown backslash-escapes inventory text, and `minimum-elements` Markdown quotes it as code spans |

Paths inside the scan root are recorded relative to it, so an inventory does not
depend on where the checkout lives. A record is labeled with how it was
established; the [glossary](glossary.md) defines declared, observed and verified,
and the [security model](security-model.md) explains how far each goes.

## Adding a collector

The collector set is closed. `scanner_catalog.py` names the built-in collectors,
and coverage is complete only when every one of them completed, so adding one
changes what a complete scan requires: inventories written before it lack its
status and become partial. A new collector:

- extends `scanners/base.py:Scanner`, returns a `ScanResult`, and reads only through
  `Scanner._collection`, which records the confined reader's failures and gaps on
  that result;
- records a recognized input it cannot collect as a gap (`surfaces_excluded`) and a
  read or parse problem as a failure (`scan_failures`), never as silence;
- never executes, imports or loads what it reads, and records paths that are inside
  the root or relative to it;
- is added to `scanner_catalog.py`, `scanners.ALL_SCANNERS`, the CLI registry, the
  policy's collector names and the Action runner's list;
  `tests/test_coverage_security.py` checks the catalog against the collector and
  Action lists;
- comes with tests for hostile input: oversized, malformed, deeply nested and
  symlinked files.
