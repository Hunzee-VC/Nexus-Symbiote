# Deployment-scoped authority claims

The optional `deployment_profile` on a native AgentBOM agent records the deployment ID, environment, optional tenant and workload identity, and a list of scoped authority claims. Existing documents without a profile remain valid. This profile does not discover permissions or enforce access.

Each authority claim separates **kind** (`declared`, `effective`, or `observed`) from the producer's **claim state** (`declared`, `observed`, `verified`, `unknown`, or `not-applicable`). A known claim identifies a principal, action and resource and cites at least one evidence record. An unknown claim requires a reason and contains no permission assertion; it does not mean the principal has no permissions. A not-applicable claim likewise is not a negative inventory assertion. Use explicit scopes, rather than assuming a resource or audience.

Evidence records state their source, collector, and collection time. A producer-reported verified record must include its subject's SHA-256 digest, verifier, verification policy and verification time. These constraints check *record structure only*. Importing a record with `verification_status: verified` or a claim with `state: verified` does not verify a signature, prove that the verifier is trusted, establish freshness, or authorize a call. Consumers must verify evidence and its subject under their own trust and freshness policy. No secrets, raw credentials, token-bearing URLs, or private prompt content should be placed in provenance identifiers.

The native JSON representation preserves these fields. CycloneDX and SPDX exports also embed the native document, including the profile, in a digest-bound `nexus-symbiote:document` extension. SymBiote can recover the profile when a consumer preserves that extension and the digest; the digest detects changes but does not authenticate the producer. The profile is not fully represented as native CycloneDX or SPDX authority semantics, and consumers that discard or ignore the extension cannot be assumed to retain it. Retain the native BOM and validate the complete downstream path. The embedded loss report identifies selected security-sensitive fields requiring the extension; it is not an exhaustive field-by-field mapping. Its JSON Pointer paths refer to the sorted native document identified by `sourceDigest`. The report is not authenticated by that digest; authenticate the complete export or reproduce the report from the native inventory before relying on it. The BOM schema and generated standalone `schemas/deployment-profile-1.0.schema.json` validate field shape; cross-field semantics are additionally enforced by the Python model.
