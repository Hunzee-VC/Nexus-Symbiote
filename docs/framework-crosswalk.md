# Framework crosswalk

Security and compliance reviews ask how each finding relates to the frameworks they
work with. This catalog answers that in one place: for every finding category, the
entries of the OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications (2025 and 2026 editions), the OWASP
Top 10 for Agentic Applications, MITRE ATLAS, the NIST AI RMF, the EU AI Act, ISO/IEC
42001 and CWE that its findings bear on, each with a one-line rationale. SARIF rules
take their taxonomy tags from it, and the `crosswalk` command applies it to the
findings of an inventory. The [finding catalog](finding-catalog.md) says what each
category records.

- [What a reference means](#what-a-reference-means)
- [The crosswalk command](#the-crosswalk-command)
- [SARIF tags](#sarif-tags)
- [Limits](#limits)

- [Entries](#entries)

## What a reference means

> A reference means that the finding records a precondition for the framework entry, a weakness of its type, or evidence relevant to it. It does not mean that a technique was used, that an attack happened, that a control fails or is met, or that a legal obligation applies. Findings describe what the inventory records; neither a finding nor its absence shows that an agent, model or tool is safe.

A reference ties one finding category to one entry of one framework edition. A
category can record several kinds of finding, which the finding catalog describes. A
reference holds for every kind that the category records, and one that holds only at
some severities names them in its Severities column. For example, `data_integrity`
findings are tied to CWE-319 at high and critical severity, where they record a
retrieval endpoint or connection without encryption, but not at medium severity, where
they record a RAG source that declares no content filtering. Where no reference holds
for every kind, none is made. `launch_context` has no MITRE ATLAS reference, although
its privileged-mode findings are preconditions for AML.T0105 Escape to Host, because a
high `launch_context` finding can also record only a command-valued field. Medium
`nonregistry_source` findings have no reference at all, because they also record
workspace members and local paths, which can be the project's own packages. The
exceptions are references that the earlier SARIF rules carried: they were kept so that
those rules keep their tags, their rationales name the kind of finding they do not hold
for, and [Limits](#limits) lists them.

A category without a reference in a framework says nothing about whether the risks of
that framework are present: the mapping states what findings record, not what a
project is free of.

Every identifier carries its edition. The 2026 edition of the OWASP Top 10 for LLM
Applications renumbered the list, so LLM03:2025 is Supply Chain and LLM03:2026 is
Excessive Agency. MITRE ATLAS names changed between releases too; this catalog uses
release 2026.10. An EU AI Act article is named where a finding can serve as evidence:
whether the article applies depends on the system's risk class and the operator's role,
which an inventory cannot establish, and a reference never says that an obligation
applies or is met. NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act and ISO/IEC 42001 titles are this project's
short summaries, not the text of those documents.

## The crosswalk command

```text
nexus-symbiote crosswalk INVENTORY [--framework NAME ...] [--format json|markdown] [-o FILE]
```

`crosswalk` reads a native inventory and takes its findings exactly as `risk` scores
them under the built-in policy: no project policy is read, so no finding is suppressed
or ignored, and the findings that `risk` adds from a model's recorded fields are
included. For each framework edition, every one or each that a `--framework` names, it
lists every entry that a finding references, with those findings, and then the
categories whose findings reference no entry of the selected editions. It runs offline
and is a report, not a gate: exit status 0 means only that the report was written. An
inventory that cannot be read, or a report that cannot be written, ends it with exit
status 1.

JSON, the default, is a document with `format` `nexus-symbiote/crosswalk/v1` and
sorted keys:

- `meaning`: the text quoted under [what a reference means](#what-a-reference-means);
- `policy_source`: `built-in`; `suppressed_findings` and `ignored_findings`: how many
  findings the policy left out, which the built-in policy never does;
- `coverage_status`: collection coverage as `risk` assesses it;
- `findings`: sorted by severity, category, component and detail, each with its
  `category`, `severity`, `component_ref` and `detail`, in which control,
  bidirectional and invisible characters are replaced as on a terminal;
- `frameworks`: one per selected edition, in the order of the Editions table, with its
  `framework` key, `name`, `edition`, `source`, `verification`, `note`,
  `findings_with_reference`, `findings_without_reference` and `entries`. Each entry has
  its `entry` identifier, `title`, `severity_counts`, the `categories` that reference it
  with their `rationale`, and `findings`, the positions of its findings in the
  `findings` list. Entries that no finding references are not listed;
- `unmapped_categories`: the categories with findings that reference no entry of the
  selected editions, each with the number of such `findings` and whether the category is
  `in_catalog`, which an edited inventory or another version can make false.

Markdown (`--format markdown`) states what a reference means at the top, then gives a
summary table, a table of the referenced entries of each edition and, under each entry,
its rationales and its findings. Text from the inventory is escaped: control,
bidirectional and invisible characters become U+FFFD, a `##` CI log command is broken,
and every ASCII punctuation character is backslash-escaped, so that no table cell, link,
emphasis, code span or HTML can form from it; a terminal shows the backslashes. Each such
text is cut at 1,000 characters, ending with `...`, and at most 100 findings are listed
under one entry, followed by the number of the others; the JSON format lists every one.
`-o` writes the report to a file as every output file is written, and refuses a path
that names the inventory itself.

On the demo agent, scanned without `NEXUS_SYMBIOTE_SOURCE_BINDING_KEY` as in the
[walkthrough](../examples/README.md), which is why its `completeness` findings appear:

```bash
nexus-symbiote scan examples/demo-agent -o demo.aibom.json
nexus-symbiote crosswalk demo.aibom.json --framework mitre-atlas-2026.10 --format markdown
```

```text
# Framework crosswalk

A reference means that the finding records a precondition for the framework entry, a weakness of its type, or evidence relevant to it. It does not mean that a technique was used, that an attack happened, that a control fails or is met, or that a legal obligation applies. Findings describe what the inventory records; neither a finding nor its absence shows that an agent, model or tool is safe.

Findings: 10, as `risk` scores them under the built-in policy, with 0 suppressed and 0 ignored. Collection coverage, as `risk` assesses it: reported.

Entries that no finding references are not listed; that says nothing about whether the risk an entry names is present.

```

## SARIF tags

SARIF rules carry the entries of the threat and weakness taxonomies as tags in the
forms that the Editions table shows, in lower case as GitHub normalizes tags: CWE, the
OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications 2025 and 2026, the OWASP Top 10 for Agentic
Applications, MITRE ATLAS and the NIST AI RMF. Every tag that a rule carried before
this catalog is still there, in the same order, so a filter on it still matches, and
the 2026, ATLAS and NIST tags follow them. The rules of the 21 categories that had no
earlier catalog entry, and of `runtime_undeclared`, were generic rules tagged only
`security`; most of them now carry CWE, OWASP 2025 or Agentic tags as well, so a filter
on such a tag, such as `external/owasp-llm-top-10-2025/llm03`, also matches their
findings. EU AI Act and ISO/IEC 42001 entries are not tags, because they name neither
threats nor weaknesses; only the `crosswalk` report shows them. No rule has more than
ten tags.
[Standard exports](standard-exports.md#sarif-for-github-code-scanning) lists the tags of
every rule.

## Limits

- A reference is this project's reviewed statement, not a mapping that the owner of the
  framework published or reviewed.
- Some references were kept from the earlier SARIF rules, so that those rules keep
  their tags, although they do not hold for every kind of finding that their category
  records, as their rationales say: CWE-319 on `transport_security` does not hold for
  an endpoint URL that uses HTTPS but embeds credentials, or whose transport is unknown
  rather than unencrypted; ASI07 on `transport_security` does not hold for low findings
  on retrieval locators, which name data sources, not agents; CWE-502 on
  `serialization_format` does not hold for chat template findings, which are critical
  like those on code-executing formats; and CWE-306 on `authentication` does not hold
  for A2A client findings, which record only the client's own configuration. The
  earlier rules also put CWE-1336 on high `serialization_format` findings, which the
  collectors do not record; it stays on that rule.
- NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001 and CWE identifiers were checked against
  secondary sources only, as the Editions table says.
- `crosswalk` applies only the built-in policy. Findings on components imported from a
  ShadowScan report are included, as `risk` includes them, although SARIF and VEX
  leave them out.
- The report does not identify the inventory it was made from; keep the two together.
- Escaping stops Markdown markup, not the text filters of a renderer: GitHub, for
  example, can still show an `@name` or `:name:` in rendered text as a mention or an
  emoji.

| `cwe` | CWE-1427 Improper Neutralization of Input Used for LLM Prompting | all | Instruction text reaches the model with characters that are not neutralized. |

### `capability_scope`

| Framework | Entry | Severities | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `owasp-llm-2025` | LLM06:2025 Excessive Agency | all | A tool with destructive or financial effects, or misdeclared as read-only, raises the impact of what the agent can do. |

### `code_execution`

| Framework | Entry | Severities | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `owasp-llm-2025` | LLM03:2025 Supply Chain | all | Code from a model repository runs when the model loads, a supply chain weakness. |
