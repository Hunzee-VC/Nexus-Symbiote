# Reproducible inventories

Scan one checkout twice and you get the same inventory: SymBiote records no collection
time unless you ask for one, writes components and dependencies sorted, and derives the
serial number from the content. This page lists the fields that record the collection
event, describes the content digest that leaves them out and the serial number derived
from it, and shows how `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` records a collection time while keeping the
files byte-identical.

## What differs between two collections

An inventory records paths relative to the scanned directory, so where a checkout lies
does not enter it. Two scans of the same checkout, with the same tool and settings,
can differ only in fields that record the collection event:

| Field | What a scan writes |
|---|---|
| `metadata.serial_number` | `urn:uuid:` and a version 5 UUID of the content digest (see [the serial number](#the-serial-number)) |
| `metadata.timestamp` | Nothing; with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` set, that instant |
| `metadata.completeness.timestamp` | The same as `metadata.timestamp` |
| `components[].claims.<name>.observed_at` | The same, in each claim a collector attached |
| `metadata.completeness.source_report_path` | Only with a ShadowScan report: where it was read from, relative to the scanned directory for `scan`, and its file name for `import-shadowscan` |

`import-shadowscan` writes the serial number, `metadata.timestamp` and the report's
file name; its records carry no collection times.

By default, then, two scans of the same checkout write byte-identical native JSON and
CycloneDX files, and so the same SHA-256 of the file's bytes and the same canonical
digest that a signed runtime snapshot binds (`runtime digest --kind bom`). SPDX requires
a creation time, so without a recorded one an SPDX export writes the time of the export
as `CreationInfo.created`, and two SPDX files differ in that field only. SARIF writes
`endTimeUtc` only when the inventory records a time; its file locations depend on the
working directory (see [below](#byte-identical-files-with-source_date_epoch)). Two
imports of copies of one report under different file names differ in
`source_report_path`, and so in their bytes, but not in their content digest or serial
number.

## The content digest

`nexus-symbiote digest` prints the content digest as `content_digest`, and its profile,
`nexus-symbiote/inventory-content/v1`, as `content_profile`; see the
[CLI reference](cli-reference.md#digest). It is the SHA-256 of the RFC 8785 canonical
JSON of the native document as parsed from the file, with these fields left out:

- `metadata.serial_number`, when it is null or a `urn:uuid:` URN in lower-case
  hexadecimal;
- `metadata.completeness.source_report_path`, when it is a string: where an imported
  report was read from is not part of what it records;
- `metadata.timestamp`, `metadata.completeness.timestamp` and the `observed_at` of each
  component claim, when null or an RFC 3339 timestamp of the form
  `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss`, with up to nine digits of fractional seconds, and `Z` or a
  `+hh:mm` or `-hh:mm` offset.

A field is left out only at that location, only when the object that holds it is a
JSON object, and only when its value has that shape. Everything else is content:

- a key with one of these names anywhere else, such as in `properties`, in a dependency
  edge or in a deployment profile, so that a change cannot hide behind a field that is
  merely named like a collection event;
- any other value at these locations, such as a timestamp without a time of day;
- the order of every list, `components` and `dependencies` included (this build writes
  both sorted; see [limits](#limits));
- the tool version, the governing policy and its relaxations, and the whole coverage
  record.

The document must be a JSON object with a `components` list. A document without a
`metadata` key is read, as every command reads it, with an empty `metadata` object, so
it has the content digest of the same document with `"metadata": {}`.
The digest covers the document as it is in the file: reading an inventory into the
model and writing it again can fill in defaults and rewrite timestamps, which makes a
different document. A change to what is left out is a new profile version; the
known-answer vectors in `tests/vectors/inventory-content-v1.json` pin this one.

Equal content digests establish that two documents record the same content, field for
field, apart from when and in which run each was collected. They do not establish who
produced either file, that either is genuine or complete, or that what they record is
safe: a forged inventory that copies a genuine one's content has the same content
digest. Compare content digests of inventories that came from sources you trust, and
use the SHA-256 of the file to name an exact file.

## The serial number

When an inventory is written without a serial number, which is how `scan`, `baseline`
and `import-shadowscan` build one, SymBiote sets `metadata.serial_number` to `urn:uuid:`
followed by the version 5 UUID of the content digest, as `digest` prints it, in the
namespace `ccaa2a43-8ba9-58e6-8f22-f8793a2039d5`. The serial number is not content, so
anyone who holds the native JSON file can recompute it from that file, and it names the
content: two inventories of the same content have the same serial number, whatever
instant each records and wherever an imported report was read from. CycloneDX and SPDX
exports carry the same serial number and embed the native document as the native file
records it. It is a name, not a digest: compare content digests to compare content.

An inventory whose content digest cannot be computed, because it holds a value outside
the I-JSON domain, such as a lone surrogate, or nests too deeply, has no serial number
and is not written: `scan` and `import-shadowscan` exit 1.

## Byte-identical files with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`

Set `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, the variable that reproducible builds use, to a whole number
of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z: 1 to 12 ASCII digits, at most 253402300799
(9999-12-31T23:59:59Z). Then `scan`, `baseline`, which runs `scan`, and
`import-shadowscan` record that instant as `metadata.timestamp` and, for a scan, in
every other time field of the table above. The serial number does not change: the
recorded time is not content.

CycloneDX writes that instant as `metadata.timestamp` and SPDX as
`CreationInfo.created`, so the same inputs give byte-identical native JSON, CycloneDX
and SPDX files, and `vex` gives identical documents for them. SARIF records file
locations relative to the working directory when the scanned directory lies below it,
and relative to the scanned directory otherwise. Two SARIF files are therefore
identical when the scanned directory lies at the same path below the working directory
in both scans, or below it in neither: a scan run from inside the scanned directory, as
CI and the pre-commit hooks do, and a scan of a directory elsewhere record the same
locations.

Any other value, such as an empty, signed, fractional or hexadecimal number, one with
spaces, one of more than 12 digits or one after the year 9999, is a usage error (exit
status 2) before anything is collected, and the message does not repeat it. Without
the variable an inventory records no collection time.

No gate and no other command reads the variable:

- Gates keep using the clock. An expired suppression stays expired whatever instant
  the inventory records: `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is often a commit time, which whoever
  makes the commit can choose.
- `discover-mcp --record` and `verify-live --record` record when they observed the
  server.

The release workflow exports the variable, set to the commit time, for its whole build
job. The `project.cdx.json` it publishes as release evidence therefore records the
commit time as its collection time; its serial number is derived from its content; see
[releasing](releasing.md#what-the-pipeline-guarantees).

## Example

From the repository root, without `NEXUS_SYMBIOTE_SOURCE_BINDING_KEY` in the
environment:

```console
$ demo="$PWD/examples/demo-agent"
$ cd "$(mktemp -d)"
$ export SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1767225600
$ cp -R "$demo" first && mkdir -p ci/work && cp -R "$demo" ci/work/second
$ nexus-symbiote scan first -o first.json 2>/dev/null
$ nexus-symbiote scan ci/work/second -o second.json 2>/dev/null
$ cmp first.json second.json && echo identical
identical
$ nexus-symbiote digest first.json
file_sha256: sha256:da67363ac2029fbe1b5f665468914865baee65a955e3aa81c17e59a0a1840333
canonical_digest: sha256:55837ea79fa907c2846917b487d83c82866ce3b6026749b00853d43c2aa7764e
content_digest: sha256:794bc288b0a155c8faef008921f54b3df5829eabd05b008f95e51b00b1821f05
content_profile: nexus-symbiote/inventory-content/v1
spec_version: 1.1.0
components: 11
```

Without the variable, a scan records no collection time, so its file differs from the
pinned one, but its content digest and serial number are the same, and a second scan
writes the same bytes:

```console
$ unset SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
$ nexus-symbiote scan "$demo" -o now.json 2>/dev/null
$ cmp -s first.json now.json || echo different
different
$ nexus-symbiote digest now.json --json-output | grep content_digest
  "content_digest": "sha256:794bc288b0a155c8faef008921f54b3df5829eabd05b008f95e51b00b1821f05",
$ grep serial_number first.json now.json
first.json:    "serial_number": "urn:uuid:f6d0bcd5-2e26-5553-8994-80baa6dcc2aa",
now.json:    "serial_number": "urn:uuid:f6d0bcd5-2e26-5553-8994-80baa6dcc2aa",
$ nexus-symbiote scan "$demo" -o again.json 2>/dev/null
$ cmp now.json again.json && echo identical
identical
```

These are the digests of this tree's scan of the demo; a release that records anything
differently prints others. `tests/test_reproducible_inventory.py` checks this page
against the current tree.

## Limits

- **Content can change for reasons other than the checkout.** The tool version is
  content, and another release can record more or differently. So are the governing
  policy (`policy_source`, `policy_weakened`, the exclusions), the collectors selected
  with `--scanner`, the [collection limits](collection-limits.md), which decide what is
  a gap, and `NEXUS_SYMBIOTE_SOURCE_BINDING_KEY`, which keys the settings bindings (see
  [source binding](verification-source-binding.md)). Take the inventories you compare
  the same way; see
  [take both snapshots the same way](drift-gate.md#take-both-snapshots-the-same-way).
- **List order is content.** This build writes components and dependencies sorted, and
  the CycloneDX and SPDX exports embed the native document as written, so a native
  document recovered from an export is the native file. A document written by another
  build, or edited by hand, with its lists in another order has another content digest
  than its sorted rewrite, although it records the same inventory; its serial number,
  if it has one, may not be the one this build would derive.
- **SARIF locations depend on the working directory**, as described above.
- **A document nested deeper than 128 levels is not read.** Every command refuses a
  native inventory whose arrays and objects nest more than 128 levels, the root
  counted, with "inventory nests deeper than 128 levels"; the bound is fixed, so what
  one caller reads, every caller reads. A collected inventory nests far less.
- **A readable inventory can lack a digest.** A document without a `components` list
  has no content digest. A runtime snapshot binds a document only
  when its compact JSON, with every character outside ASCII escaped and each number
  counted as 24 bytes, is at most 16 MiB, it holds at most 1,000,000 values and no value
  is nested more than 64 levels deep; any other document has no canonical digest. A
  native inventory may be up to 16 MiB as written, so one with much text outside ASCII,
  or many numbers, can lack a canonical digest at a fraction of that size. `digest`
  prints `unavailable` for a missing digest and every other value as usual, and exits 1.
- **File names are input.** An inventory records names as the operating system lists
  them, so a checkout whose names differ between machines, for example after Unicode
  normalization, records different paths. The byte-identical results on this page were
  checked with copies of a checkout on one file system.
- **A digest is not a signature.** No digest on this page says who wrote a file.
