"""Require enforced checks, successful workflow evidence and release prerequisites.

Read-only. For the published SHA it requires branch protection, the newest trusted CI run
to have succeeded, and, with ``--publish``, the release-tag ruleset and the index
environment's protection. Publishing to PyPI also requires the commit to have been on the
branch for 24 hours, as its trusted CI runs show (``SOAK_OVERRIDE`` with a stated reason
waives that for an urgent fix), and the signed release tag to point at it. Only an
administrator's token can see who may bypass the ruleset: the workflow reports that it
could not, and ``--verify-bypass-actors``, for the administrator's own run, fails unless
the list is readable and empty and GitHub reports that the token cannot bypass it either.
Administrative configuration is a separate operator action; a checked-in policy file does
not protect a GitHub branch.
