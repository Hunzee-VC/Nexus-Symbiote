"""Enforce measured coverage floors, independently of rounded display values.

The package must keep its statement and branch floors, and each security-critical module
must keep its own: a well-tested package average cannot hide an untested module that
confines reads, verifies signatures, gates verdicts or enforces offline mode. The gate
scripts are measured too, and the Action's runner, which decides its gate outcomes, has a
floor of its own. A listed file missing from the report, or a report without the scripts,
fails. The measured figures are printed, and written to the job summary in CI; the floors
only rise, as missing paths gain tests.
