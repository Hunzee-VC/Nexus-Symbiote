"""Framework crosswalk: the framework entries that each finding category bears on.

A reference attaches one entry of one framework edition to a finding category, with a
one-line rationale. It says that a finding of that category records a precondition for
the entry, a weakness of its type, or evidence relevant to it; it never says that a
technique was used or an attack happened, that a control fails or is met, or that a
legal obligation applies. A category can record different kinds of finding at different
severities, so a reference limited to some severities holds only for findings of those
severities. A reference holds for every kind of finding that the category records at
its severities, except references kept from the earlier SARIF rules so that those rules
keep their tags: the rationale of each names the kind of finding it does not hold for.
An empty mapping says only that no reference was defensible.

Framework editions, their sources and how their identifiers were checked are data here.
SARIF tags, the ``crosswalk`` report and docs/framework-crosswalk.md derive from these
tables, and the tests check every identifier and verbatim name against its edition.
