"""The ``crosswalk`` command: the framework entries that an inventory's findings bear on.

The findings are exactly those that ``risk`` scores under the built-in policy: no project
policy applies, so nothing is suppressed or ignored, and the findings that ``risk`` derives
from a model's recorded fields are included. For each selected framework edition the
report lists every entry that a finding references, with those findings, and the
categories whose findings reference no entry. It is a report, not a gate: exit status 0
says only that the report was written.

What a reference means is fixed text from the catalog (``crosswalk.MEANING``) in every
report. Inventory text appears in JSON as strings: the finding detail neutralized as on a
terminal, the category and component reference exactly as recorded, so that consumers can
match them and must escape them; in Markdown every piece of it is escaped so that no
renderer reads it as markup.
