"""The ``minimum-elements`` command: G7 AI SBOM minimum-element coverage of an inventory.

The report says which elements the CycloneDX export of an inventory carries in
standard fields, generated in memory and never written. It is not a compliance
verdict; ``--fail-under`` is an opt-in gate on the one ratio the report prints.
Inventory text reaches the report only as component references, neutralized for
terminals and CI logs and set as inert code spans in Markdown.
